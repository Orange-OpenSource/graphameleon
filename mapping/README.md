# Graphameleon - mapping rule set

This folder contains the definition of the mapping rules for Graphameleon.

The mapping rules are provided in Turtle/[RML](https://rml.io/specs/rml/) and YAML/[YARRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/) syntax.

For each rule set, you can refer to the associated Markdown file (e.g. `rules.ttl.md`) for the documentation and a human-friendly visualization of the mapping rules.

To (re)generate the documentation, run `make doc-rml` from the project's root folder.
